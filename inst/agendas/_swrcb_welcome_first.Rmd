  - Our Code of Conduct ([full version](https://www.openscapes.org/code-of-conduct/))
    - Be respectful and value each other’s ideas, styles and viewpoints.

    - Lead by example and match your actions with your words.
    - If you have issues, please direct them to:
      - Julie - [julie@openscapes.org](mailto:julie@openscapes.org)
  - We are all responsible for being aware of [positionality](https://indigenousinitiatives.ctlt.ubc.ca/classroom-climate/positionality-and-intersectionality/) & power dynamics - how differences in social position and power shape identities and access in society. We want to be mindful of how hierarchy can get in the way of our learning. Here, we’ll work to flatten that hierarchy.
  - We know there is a range of technical experience – by design! We are all here because we want to improve something about our work around data-intensive science. We all bring value in our experiences, questions, and skills.
  - We’re all imperfect and learning together – Openscapes included
    - We're all accountable to each other
    - Vulnerability: yes! Shame: no.
    - If something doesn’t feel right, let’s talk about it
  - The pandemic
