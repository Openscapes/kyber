-   **Inclusion Tip of the Day** (1 min) – Anna
-   Be mindful of words and idioms you use. Move away from language that is racist, sexist, violent, ableist, etc.
-   Examples:
    -   Use “main” instead of “master” (GitHub branches, bedrooms)

    -   Welcome people to meetings with gender-neutral/gender-inclusive language, like “Hi all/everyone/folks/team” instead of “Hi guys/ladies”

    -   Consider “safelist” and “blocklist” instead of “whitelist” and “blacklist” - While the origin of whitelist/blacklist is not itself racist, reinforcing the negative stereotype of “black equals bad” is important to challenge (Lewis 2018, [Language Matters](https://medium.com/@bronAtNuna/language-matters-7fced5d78f8d))
