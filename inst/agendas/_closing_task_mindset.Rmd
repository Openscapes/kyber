*We've covered a lot today; we'll explore these ideas more deeply together in the next weeks.*

-   **Task for next time** (5 min) -- Julie

    -   **Have a Seaside Chat & start your Pathway**
    -   Seaside chat: self-organized meeting for dedicated data/workflow discussions. Include others!
    -   Start discussing your trailhead: where are you now?
    -   To structure your thoughts, you can use the Pathways Sheet (screenshare)
        -   Create a copy of [Pathways Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rmhOly87OYrPOUqTzmccYbPrTlGmXGsN06GI1FKzxag/edit#gid=0) (File \> Make a copy \> in our shared folder). Focus on the "now" column. Are there rows to add?

    -   **Create GitHub usernames**
        -   Optional advice: <https://happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html>
        -   Share your GitHub username before next time in our ParticipantsList (in our Cohort Folder, linked from the top of this doc)
    -   **Join Slack** (we'll invite you to our Openscapes org)
        -   Introduce yourself and tag your team
            -   Private channel for our cohort as you get comfortable
