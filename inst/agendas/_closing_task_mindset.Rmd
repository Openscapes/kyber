    -   **Create GitHub usernames**
        -   Optional advice: <https://happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html>
        -   Share your GitHub username before next time in our ParticipantsList (in our Cohort Folder, linked from the top of this doc)
    -   **Join Slack** (we'll invite you to our Openscapes org)
        -   Introduce yourself and tag your team
