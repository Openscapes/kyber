    -   **Land Acknowledgment**
        -   Nearly 200 tribal nations are located within the modern borders of California - more than any other state in the United States. The CalEPA building - and the hub of our agency - is located in a place we call Sacramento. Sacramento was, and still is, a gathering place for many local Tribes who have lived throughout the central valley and the foothills for generations and were the original stewards of this land. These people include the Nisenan, Maidu, and Miwok Peoples, and the Patwin and Wintun Nations. We want to honor the peoples who have remained committed to the stewardship of these lands and waters over many centuries.
