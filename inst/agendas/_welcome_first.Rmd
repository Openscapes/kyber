  - We want to be mindful of how hierarchy can get in the way of our learning. Here, we’ll work to flatten that hierarchy.
  - We know there is a range of technical experience – by design! We are all here because we want to improve our work around data-intensive science, get a sense of new software and approaches, reduce friction when collaborating with others, promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in our work and communities, and develop leadership skills.
  - We’re all imperfect and learning together – Openscapes included
    - We're all accountable to each other
    - Vulnerability: yes! Shame: no.
    - If something doesn’t feel right, let’s talk about it
  - The pandemic
