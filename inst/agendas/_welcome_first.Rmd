    -   We are all responsible for being aware of [positionality](https://indigenousinitiatives.ctlt.ubc.ca/classroom-climate/positionality-and-intersectionality/) & power dynamics - how differences in social position and power shape identities and access in society.

    -   We know there is a range of technical experience ‚Äì by design! We are all here because we want to improve something about our work. We all bring value in our experiences, questions, and skills.
    -   We‚Äôre all imperfect and learning together ‚Äì Openscapes included
        -   We're all accountable to each other
        -   Vulnerability: yes! Shame: no.
        -   If something doesn‚Äôt feel right, let‚Äôs talk about it
    -   The pandemic still affecting us, the climate emergency, it‚Äôs all a lot. ‚Äé
