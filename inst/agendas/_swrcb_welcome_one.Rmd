-   We‚Äôre so excited to go through the Openscapes process with you over the next 10 weeks - Let's dive in!
-   **Openscapes Team here on this call**:
    -   Anna Holder, Environmental Scientist and Tribal Coordinator in OIMA (Lead Instructor)
    -   [insert other instructors and mentors ...]
    -   We‚Äôre all here to lead the calls and support with behind the scene logistics - if you have questions at any time, feel free to reach out to any one of us!
-   **Land Acknowledgment**
    -   Nearly 200 tribal nations are located within the modern borders of California - more than any other state in the United States. The CalEPA building - and the hub of our agency - is located in a place we call Sacramento. Sacramento was, and still is, a gathering place for many local Tribes who have lived throughout the central valley and the foothills for generations and were the original stewards of this land. These people include the Nisenan, Maidu, and Miwok Peoples, and the Patwin and Wintun Nations. We want to honor the peoples who have remained committed to the stewardship of these lands and waters over many centuries.
        -   Here‚Äôs a place you can go to learn more about the land you're on: <https://native-land.ca/>
-   **Cohort goals**

-   **You are all welcome here** (3 min) ‚Äì Anna
    -   This is a positive learning space where everyone is welcome to ask questions and participate.
    -   We‚Äôre adopting the Openscapes Code of Conduct ([full version](https://www.openscapes.org/code-of-conduct/))
        -   Be respectful and value each other‚Äôs ideas, styles and viewpoints.
        -   Be direct but professional; we cannot withhold hard truths.
        -   Be inclusive and help new perspectives be heard.
        -   Be open to learning from others.
        -   Lead by example and match your actions with your words.
        -   Aligns with [Water Boards Racial Equity Resolution](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/racial_equity/resolution-and-actions.html) & general expectations as Water Boards employees to treat each other with respect and professionalism.
        -   If you have issues, please direct them to:
            -   Anna - [anna.holder\@waterboards.ca.gov](mailto:anna.holder@waterboards.ca.gov)
            -   All Cohort calls are subject to Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) reporting requirements, and facilitators may be obligated to report instances of past or current racial discrimination at the Water Boards. If you choose to share your experiences, consider not including identifying information (e.g., names, titles, office, department, division, agency, etc.), and be aware that the EEO Office may be obligated to investigate and follow up.
            -   Employees who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint through the [Water Boards discrimination complaint process](http://waternet/eeo/discrimination/index.shtml).
    -   We are all responsible for being aware of [positionality](https://indigenousinitiatives.ctlt.ubc.ca/classroom-climate/positionality-and-intersectionality/), privilege & power dynamics - how differences in social position and power shape identities and access in society. We want to be mindful of how hierarchy can get in the way of our learning. Here, we‚Äôll work to flatten that hierarchy.
        -   Anna has given a couple of talks that include more information on privilege & power - you can check out the recordings at:

    -   We‚Äôre all imperfect and learning together ‚Äì Openscapes included
        -   We're all accountable to each other
        -   Vulnerability: yes! Shame: no.
