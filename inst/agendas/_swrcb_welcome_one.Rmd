    -   *Instruction Team*: Anna Holder (OIMA), Tina Ures (DWQ)
    -   *Cohort Mentors*: [ insert mentors (RDO) ]

-   **Land Acknowledgment**
    -   Nearly 200 tribal nations are located within the modern borders of California - more than any other state in the United States. The CalEPA building - and the hub of our agency - is located in a place we call Sacramento. Sacramento was, and still is, a gathering place for many local Tribes who have lived throughout the central valley and the foothills for generations and were the original stewards of this land. These people include the Nisenan, Maidu, and Miwok Peoples, and the Patwin and Wintun Nations. We want to honor the peoples who have remained committed to the stewardship of these lands and waters over many centuries.
        -   Here’s a place you can go to learn more about the land you're on: <https://native-land.ca/>
-   **Cohort goals**
    -   To strengthen team culture and habits for immediate benefit that will help create long-lasting resilience in teams and workflows.
-   **Today’s goals**
    -   ‎We'll start working towards a common understanding of the Openscapes mindset and what your pathway forward looks like for your team
-   **You are all welcome here**
    -   This is a positive learning space where everyone is welcome to ask questions and participate.
    -   We’re adopting the Openscapes Code of Conduct ([full version](https://www.openscapes.org/code-of-conduct/))
        -   Be respectful and value each other’s ideas, styles and viewpoints.
        -   Be direct but professional; we cannot withhold hard truths.
        -   Be inclusive and help new perspectives be heard.
        -   Be open to learning from others.
        -   Lead by example and match your actions with your words.
        -   Aligns with [Water Boards Racial Equity Resolution](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/racial_equity/resolution-and-actions.html) & general expectations as Water Boards employees to treat each other with respect and professionalism.
        -   If you have issues, please direct them to:
            -   Anna - [anna.holder\@waterboards.ca.gov](mailto:anna.holder@waterboards.ca.gov)
            -   All Cohort calls are subject to Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) reporting requirements, and facilitators may be obligated to report instances of past or current racial discrimination at the Water Boards. If you choose to share your experiences, consider not including identifying information (e.g., names, titles, office, department, division, agency, etc.), and be aware that the EEO Office may be obligated to investigate and follow up.
            -   Employees who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint through the [Water Boards discrimination complaint process](http://waternet/eeo/discrimination/index.shtml).
    -   We are all responsible for being aware of [positionality](https://indigenousinitiatives.ctlt.ubc.ca/classroom-climate/positionality-and-intersectionality/), privilege & power dynamics - how differences in social position and power shape identities and access in society. We want to be mindful of how hierarchy can get in the way of our learning. Here, we’ll work to flatten that hierarchy.
        -   Anna has given a couple of talks that include more information on privilege & power - you can check out the recordings at:
            -   Joint Aquatic Sciences Meeting's Open Science for Collaborative Management of Aquatic Ecosystems Session (May 16, 2022): [Operationalizing Open Science and Equity in California’s Surface Water Ambient Monitoring Programs](https://youtu.be/80HWwyELmMk) (26 min)

    -   We know there is a range of technical experience – by design! We are all here because we want to improve something about our work around data-intensive science. We all bring value in our experiences, questions, and skills.
    -   We’re all imperfect and learning together – Openscapes included
        -   We're all accountable to each other
        -   Vulnerability: yes! Shame: no.
        -   If something doesn’t feel right, let’s talk about it
