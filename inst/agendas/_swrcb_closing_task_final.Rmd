-   **Thank you Mentors!!!** ðŸ¤©

-   **Your Seaside Chats are a way to continue learning together**

    -   Broaden them to your broader groups, if useful following [10-week plan to supercharge your research](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03335-4) (Lowndes et al. 2019)

    -   Thinking about data analysis as a collaborative effort

    -   Identifying and addressing shared needs

    -   Thinking ahead for future us

-   **Continue to use your Pathway as a resource!**

    -   Review regularly to help continue tracking progress and documenting needs

    -   It's normal for the Pathway to evolve as Future Us develops

    -   You'll be surprised how useful it can be 1+ years from now!
