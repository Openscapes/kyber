-   **Thank you Mentors!!!** 🤩
-   **Your Seaside Chats are a way to continue learning together**
    -   Broaden them to your broader groups, if useful following [10-week plan to supercharge your research](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03335-4) (Lowndes et al. 2019)
    -   Thinking about data analysis as a collaborative effort
    -   Identifying and addressing shared needs
    -   Thinking ahead for future us
-   **Continue to use your Pathway as a resource!**
    -   Review regularly to help continue tracking progress and documenting needs
    -   It's normal for the Pathway to evolve as Future Us develops
    -   You'll be surprised how useful it can be (and how much you can achieve) 1+ years from now!
