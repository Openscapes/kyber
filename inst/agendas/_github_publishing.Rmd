  - Our cohort repo: <`r params_registry$github_repo`>
  - Edit & commit your file, and talk with your breakout group!
    - Go to our cohort repo, navigate > github-clinic > yourname.md
    - Click on the pencil to edit your file
    - Make small edits and commit with a commit message
    - Github.com will give you a default message but get into the habit of writing an actual message to yourself/others (breadcrumbs)
  - Learn anything cool? Share!
