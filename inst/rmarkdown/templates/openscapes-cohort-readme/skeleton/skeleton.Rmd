# `r db$cr$cohort_name_long`

Welcome to the `r db$cr$cohort_name_long` Cohort! This is a Cohort for [TODO: who is this cohort for?]. To learn more about what to expect (the purpose, outcomes, and process of our Cohort) and to browse the open lesson materials, please see the [Champions Program Lesson Series](https://openscapes.github.io/series).

## Cohort Agendas

We will meet as a Cohort via Zoom five times over two months for 1.5 hours each:

-   **Dates:** `r kyber:::pretty_date_sequence(db$date_range)`
-   **Times:** `r kyber:::fmt_duration(db$cr$time_start, 90)`
-   **Location:** remotely, via Zoom

Agendas are accessible to Cohort participants in our [Cohort Google Drive Folder] [TODO:link to folder]; they are also an archive of our live google-docing. Please see <https://openscapes.org/series> to view blank versions of the agendas.

<!---TODO create schedule table programmatically
```{r, echo=FALSE}

## Coworking times (optional)

Coworking sessions are where get our own work done at the same time together. Sometimes, this means quiet work with check-ins to break up focused work and get feedback, and sometimes this involves asking questions and screensharing to learn and problem solve. We will make breakout rooms so people working on related themes can meet and learn from each other.

## More about Openscapes and the Champions program:

- [**Our path to better science in less time using open data science tools**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0160) (Lowndes et al. 2017) - This describes a marine science team’s transition to open collaborative teamwork. It was the original inspiration for creating the Champions Program and heavily influences the Core Lessons. We’ll ask that everyone participating reads it before our first Cohort Call.
- [**Supercharge your research: a ten-week plan for open data science**](https://openscapes.github.io/supercharge-research/) (Lowndes et al. 2019) - This was co-authored with the inaugural Champions Cohort, capturing the most valuable take-aways for marine and environmental science early career faculty.
- [**Shifting institutional culture to develop climate solutions with Open Science**](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ece3.11341) (Lowndes et al. 2024) - This was co-authored by Openscapes mentors across organizations – including NASA Earthdata, NOAA Fisheries, EPA, California Water Boards, Pathways to Open Science, Fred Hutch Cancer Center.
