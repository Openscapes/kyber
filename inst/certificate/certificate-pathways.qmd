This certifies that `r params$participant_name` participated in the Pathways to Open Science program from Openscapes. Pathways to Open Science is a remote event series for Black environmental & marine researchers to build community for the future of data intensive science. Through a series of community calls and coworking sessions, participants gained practical data science skills and developed a mindset for Open Data Science: the tools and practices enabling reproducible, transparent, and inclusive practices for data intensive science.
