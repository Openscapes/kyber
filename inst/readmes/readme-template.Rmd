# `r params$cohort_name_long` Openscapes Champions Cohort

Welcome to the `r params$cohort_name_long` Openscapes Champions Cohort! <!---This is a Cohort for TODO FILL IN BY HAND.---> Learn more about Openscapes and the Champions Program: <https://openscapes.org>. 

<img align="right" src="horst-champions-trailhead.png" width="450">  

## Cohort Agendas

We will meet as a Cohort via Zoom four times over two months for 1.5 hours <!--- TODO FILL IN BY HAND:, on alternating Fridays in September and October 2021 --->. 

- **Dates: `r params$date_start-to-date_end-alternating-weeks` ** <!--- TODO CHECK in case nuanced schedule--->
- **Times: `r params$time_start-to-1.5 hours later ET or PT`**
- **Location: Remotely, via Zoom**

Agendas are accessible to Cohort participants in our [Cohort Google Drive Folder](`r params$google_drive_folder`); they are also an archive of our live google-docing. Please see <https://openscapes.org/series> to view blank versions of the agendas.

## More about this cohort

EXAMPLE:

**Fishery Dependent Data (FDD)** represent a complex mix of information collected to facilitate managing the region's living marine resources. In the Northeast, data flow from individual businesses and/or scientific samplers to the region's scientific and management organizations. This web of information can be difficult to access as much of the content is confidential in its raw form. Further, many of the codes and systems used to store these data are poorly documented, and even routine analyses are not commonly shared among data users. Currently, FDD are therefore difficult to integrate into scientific advice for ecosystem based fisheries management. Analysts tend to be unfamiliar with the data or hesitant to explore their potential, and data can be viewed with skepticism rather than leveraged in new and innovative ways. There is a need to begin to provide access, documentation, and cultivate a community of practice that focuses on using these data to their full potential. 

Examples of FDD data: observer data, dealer data, study fleet data, electronic monitoring data, permit data, biosampling data, DMIS data, CAMS data, VRS data

**This opportunity is funded through NOAA Fisheries Northeast Fisheries Science Center ([NEFSC](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/about/northeast-fisheries-science-center)) and a grant from the [Fisheries Information System Program](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/commercial-fishing/fisheries-information-system-program) through an award to [UMass Dartmouth-SMAST](https://www.umassd.edu/smast/) through [CINAR](http://www.cinar.org/).** It is coordinated by Gavin Fay (UMassD-SMAST), Andy Jones (NOAA NEFSC), and Rachel Baum (UMassD Claire T. Carney Library).
